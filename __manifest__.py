BlueNova Backend Theme
======================

A luxurious, modern visual reskin of the Odoo backend.

Key Features:
• Deep Royal Blue (#003087) + Electric Blue (#00AEEF) accents
• Cool Silver / Chrome metallic gradients & glossy effects
• Glassmorphic panels, cards and dropdowns
• Premium 3D-style icons and soft multi-layer shadows
• Clean white main content area with subtle depth
• Fully supports Light & Dark mode
• Applies to the entire web client (navbar, sidebar, control panel, kanban, list, form views, etc.)
• Editable light-mode colours under Settings > Theme Settings, with an
  uploadable sidebar brand image and JSON preset import / export / reset.
  Changes apply on save — no asset rebuild or server restart.
• The same theme on the login, signup and reset-password pages, including
  dark mode, an optional logo and background image, and a tagline.
• A themed Dashboard app built to the DESIGN.md reference: gradient hero
  cards with a 30-day trend, metric cards with sparklines and status
  pills, a 30-day column chart with one series per app, a recent-activity
  feed, quick "New …" actions and a preview of the user's own open work —
  all for whichever apps are installed and readable by the user, and
  optionally opened automatically after login. A floating chat bubble in
  the corner lists the user's Discuss conversations and opens any of them
  in place, with its messages and a composer — OdooBot answers, and new
  messages arrive live — while "Open Discuss" hands over to the real
  thing. Present only where Discuss itself is installed.
• An optional themed public page at / for anonymous visitors. Off by
  default, and it stands down when the `website` module is installed.

Uninstall the module to instantly return to the default Odoo look.
