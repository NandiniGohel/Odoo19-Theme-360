"""Colour arithmetic behind the settings-driven brand palette.

Not an Odoo model — a plain module imported by res_config_settings.py.

── Why this exists ──────────────────────────────────────────────

The Primary picker on Settings > Theme Settings used to repaint
exactly one custom property, ``--cmt-primary``. But a brand colour in
this theme is not one value, it is a *family*: variables.scss also
declares --cmt-primary-dark (hover/pressed fills), --cmt-primary-light
(active nav rows, list hover, kanban highlights), --cmt-primary-soft
(focus rings), --cmt-on-primary-container, --cmt-primary-rgb and the
app-icon rail's hover/active tints. Every one of those was a hardcoded
indigo, so picking green moved the buttons and left the sidebar hover,
the focus rings and the active-row wash blue.

Worse, Odoo and Bootstrap never read --cmt-* at all. Their brand is
compiled from ``$o-brand-primary`` (see scss/primary_variables.scss),
which is a build-time literal — the settings screen cannot reach it.
What it *can* reach is the handful of custom properties Bootstrap 5.3
puts on :root and then reads from everywhere: --bs-primary-rgb feeds
``.text-bg-primary`` (the "Enterprise" badge on the settings screen)
and every .bg-/.text-/.border-primary utility, and --bs-link-color-rgb
feeds reboot's ``a`` rule (every blue link in the backend).

So the settings block emits, from the one picked colour: the whole
--cmt-* brand family, and the Bootstrap :root brand vars. Both are
derived here rather than added as more pickers — asking an admin to
choose eight coordinated shades to change one brand colour is the
problem, not the feature.

── Why HSL, not channel mixing ──────────────────────────────────

Darkening by mixing toward black desaturates as it goes, which turns a
vivid green into a muddy olive at the hover state. Working in HSL keeps
the hue fixed and moves lightness and saturation independently, so a
ramp derived from #16a34a reads as the same green throughout — the way
the hand-picked indigo ramp in variables.scss does.

The multipliers below were fitted against that hand-picked ramp: fed
#3959b0 they reproduce variables.scss's values to within a couple of
percent, and fed #7c9aff they reproduce dark_mode.scss's. That is the
check that matters — a default install must look identical before and
after this module existed.

    canvas above. It was correct on the numbers and wrong on screen.

    The brand fill is *not* the only thing --cmt-on-primary lands on. It
    is the ink for .btn-primary and the outline button's filled states
    (buttons_misc.scss), the "Enterprise" pill (brand_bridge.scss), the
    chat launcher and the dashboard hero — surfaces that already sit in
    a scheme, next to buttons the picker does not move. So a mid-tone
    pick like a #16a34a green, which clears the crossover at L = 0.28,
    flipped every one of those to near-black while the theme around them
    stayed a light scheme with white button labels: the Add button on a
    To-do form came back black-on-green next to an untouched backend.

    The scheme's compiled ink is the value those surfaces are designed
    against — white in light, #0b1120 in dark — and holding it means the
    Primary picker moves fills only, which is what picking a fill colour
    is understood to do. It is also what an untouched install already
    shows, so the two cases no longer disagree.

    The cost is real and worth stating: a light scheme given a pale
    Primary (a yellow, a pastel) now gets white ink on it and can drop
    under 4.5:1, where the old crossover would have caught it. That is a
    choice about *one* colour the admin can see and re-pick, against a

    ── What was wrong ───────────────────────────────────────────

    variables.scss ships an accent family next to the brand — Ocean
    Blue #0284c7 and its container tints — and it was a compiled
    literal that no picker reached. Five tokens
    (--cmt-tertiary, --cmt-tertiary-container,
    --cmt-on-tertiary-container, --cmt-won-tint, --cmt-won-tint-hover)
    with the same value in every install.

    That is mostly invisible until you notice where --cmt-tertiary is
    spent: it is the *far stop of the dashboard hero gradient*
    (--cmt-hero-gradient-a, both schemes). So the lead card on the
    landing page ran from the picked brand into a fixed ocean blue.
    Pick green and the card faded green-to-blue; pick purple and it
    faded purple-to-blue. The block that builds those gradients in
    dark_mode.scss already states the intent it could not deliver —
    "a green brand has to produce green heroes, and no static value
    can do that" — sitting eight lines under a static --cmt-tertiary.

    The kanban won-opportunity wash, its stage counters, the selected
    kanban column and the stats banner's figures spend the same family
    and stripe the same blue through an otherwise repainted backend.

    ── Why one hue, not a second one ────────────────────────────

    The hue is *not* derived — it is copied from the brand and held.
    That is the whole point: the accent's job here is to give the hero
    gradient somewhere to travel, and it does that on lightness and
    saturation alone. Rotating the hue is what puts a colour on screen
    that the admin did not pick, which is the bug.

    The shipped pair does rotate — #3959b0 (224°) to #0284c7 (200°),
    a 24° drift — and reproducing that drift from an arbitrary brand
    is exactly what must not happen: 24° off a violet is blue again.
    So the shipped values are not reproduced here at all. They are
    preserved by *not calling this function* while Primary still holds
    the colour it shipped with, the way derive_surface_vars() is
    skipped for an untouched Background — see
    res_config_settings._accent_derived_vars(). An untouched install
    keeps its hand-picked indigo-into-ocean heroes; the first picked
    colour takes the accent with it.

# ── The neutral ramp ─────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# What derive_surface_vars() below builds out of the Background
# picker, and the mirror image of the brand ramp above: one decision,
# a dozen coordinated values.
#
# Every entry is ``(css property, Δhue, Δlightness, saturation
# factor, saturation cap)``, and every Δlightness is measured from
# *paper* — the
# lightest surface in the scheme, not from the canvas. That anchor is
# what makes the ramp survive an arbitrary pick: a mid-green canvas at
# L .73 still gets a near-white sheet, a hairline border a shade under
# it and near-black ink, because those three are spaced against each
# other rather than against whatever the admin chose. Offsets from the
# canvas would have collapsed the whole ramp into the canvas the
# moment someone picked something that was not already nearly white.
#
# The numbers are fitted, not invented: fed #f8f9fa the light table
# reproduces the Surfaces and Text blocks of variables.scss, and fed
# #0b1120 the dark table reproduces the same blocks in dark_mode.scss
# — both exactly, every channel of every token. That is the check that
# matters — a theme whose Background is left alone must look exactly
# as it did before this derivation existed, and the skip in
# _surface_derived_vars() guarantees the untouched case outright.
#
# Saturation is a *factor* on the picked colour's own, capped: the
# shipped greys carry a little of their hue (Tailwind's slate ramp,
# not neutral grey), so a factor keeps that relationship at any input,
# while the cap stops a vivid brand-as-canvas from turning the muted
# icon colour and the body ink into more of the same shout. Ink runs
# hotter than the mid-ramp on purpose — #111827 is a saturated
# near-black next to a barely-tinted #9ca3af, and that is what the
# 2.36 factor preserves.
#
# The light table's paper carries a saturation even though the colour
# it has to reproduce, #ffffff, has none. At that lightness the
# saturation is free — hsl(210, 20%, 99.9%) rounds to #ffffff on every
# channel — so the shipped white is reproduced either way, and the
# factor is what decides whether a *tinted* canvas gets a sheet that
# belongs to it or a neutral off-white slab sitting on top of it.
#
# The hue column is small and easy to mistake for noise: the shipped
# ramps are not one hue held constant, they drift about ten degrees
# from the canvas toward the ink (#f8f9fa is 210°, #111827 is 221°).
# Reproducing that drift is what takes the fit from "close" to exact,
# and it carries the same relationship onto whatever hue is picked
# instead — a colorsys hue is a turn, not degrees, hence the /360.

# How far paper sits from the canvas, as a fraction of the distance to
# white. The two schemes stack in opposite directions: on a light
# canvas paper is at the white end and everything else descends from
# it, while on a dark canvas paper is the first step *up* out of the
# near-black (.0535 of the way up from #0b1120 lands on #131c31) and
# the rest of the ramp keeps climbing past it.
#
# The light scheme has two, and which one applies is decided by how
# much colour is actually in the pick. At .95 a canvas of #f8f9fa
# lands paper on #ffffff, which is the shipped white and the whole
# reason that number is what it is — but the same .95 applied to a
# vivid green lands paper on #fafdfa, two or three steps off white per
# channel. That is a real derivation and an invisible one: every panel
# in the backend stays white and a deliberately-picked canvas looks
# like it did nothing to them.
#
# So the fraction slides toward .70 as the canvas gains saturation.
# The window is set so the two shipped canvases sit below it — the
# light one at S .17 — and a picked colour with any real chroma sits
# above it, which is what keeps "an untouched install is exactly what
# it was" and "a picked canvas visibly reaches the panels" from being
# the same dial pulling in opposite directions. Between the two ends
# it interpolates, so there is no step where one more click of
# saturation repaints the whole backend.

# like #16a34a sits at L .36, so the dark ramp put paper at .39 and

    Which direction the ramp stacks is decided by the picked colour
